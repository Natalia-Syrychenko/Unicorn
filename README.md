### Unicorn E-commerce Sales Data Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from the Unicorn e-commerce platform, covering the years 2015-2018. The objective is to uncover key insights, identify weak areas, and find opportunities for business growth.

## Project Breakdown
The project consists of four main parts:

- **Data Exploration:** Conducted using SQL queries to understand key patterns in the sales data.
- **Data Cleaning:** Processed using spreadsheets to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
- **Insights Visualization:** Leveraged Tableau to visualize findings and trends.
- **Executive Summary:** Final report and presentation of insights and recommendations.
  
## My Contribution
I conducted data analysis in a spreadsheet to generate key business insights. This included calculating total sales, profit, and average discount by region, creating dynamic dashboards with filters for yearly and monthly data, and visualizing metrics with charts. I used pivot tables and functions such as **SUMIFS**, **AVERAGEIFS**, **INDEX**, **MATCH**, **Pivot Tables** and **conditional formatting** to automate calculations and highlight important trends. Additionally, I developed a system to categorize orders by profitability and created **interactive drop-down lists** for product and category analysis
