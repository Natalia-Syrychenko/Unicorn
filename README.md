###Unicorn E-commerce Sales Data Analysis
##Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from the Unicorn e-commerce platform, covering the years 2015-2018. The objective is to uncover key insights, identify weak areas, and find opportunities for business growth.

##Project Breakdown
The project consists of four main parts:

Data Exploration: Conducted using SQL queries to understand key patterns in the sales data.
Data Cleaning: Processed using spreadsheets to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
Insights Visualization: Leveraged Tableau to visualize findings and trends.
Executive Summary: Final report and presentation of insights and recommendations.
##My Contribution
I worked primarily on the Data Cleaning phase using spreadsheets. My tasks included:

Identifying and fixing missing or incorrect data.
Standardizing formats (e.g., dates, text fields).
Removing duplicates and outliers to ensure clean, reliable data for analysis.
The cleaned dataset was then passed to the insights and visualization phase.

##Folder Structure
/Data_Exploration_SQL/ - SQL scripts used for exploring the dataset.
/Data_Cleaning_Spreadsheets/ - Spreadsheet files and documentation on the cleaning process.
/Insights_Tableau/ - Tableau visualizations and reports.
/Executive_Summary/ - Final presentation and summary.
##Tools Used
